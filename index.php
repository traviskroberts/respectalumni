			<h1>Tau Nu Alpha presents</h1>
			<h2>Respect Alumni</h2>
			<p>The phrase "Respect Alumni" has been adopted by Tau Nu Alpha as its chief slogan.  The phrase was first used by Georgia Alum and TNA member John Boren.  Its original use was to remind an underclassman to have respect for those who had come before her.  A lesson was learned, and a catchphrase was born.</p>

			<p>Since that time, "Respect Alumni" has grown into something much more.  It was decided by Auburn and Georgia alum that "Respect Alumni" would not only apply to graduates of Auburn University and the University of Georgia, but graduates (bachelor's degree and higher) of ANY university  nationwide who wanted recognition for their accomplishments.  Type of degree and grade point average have no bearing on a college graduates' degree.  TNA wishes not to discriminate against any college graduate, only to recognize and applaud their hard work and success.</p>

			<p>"Respect Alumni" is not intended to be an arrogant phrase (although we do like to joke a bit); its sole intention is to help society realize they should have respect for those who have successfully put themselves through the rigors of higher education.  And that we, as alumni, should have respect for each other, old and young, and encourage others to move forward with ambitions of becoming college graduates and alumni.</p>

			<h2>The Shirt</h2>

			<p>Be one of the first people to own the shirt that commands respect from all those in your presence.  Why spend four years at an institution of higher education just to be disrespected by every idiot that calls Wal-Mart their favorite weekend destination?  With a "Respect Alumni" shirt, you make a statement to every person that doesn't realize how inferior they are to you.</p>

			<p>Don't feel like rubbing your college education in the faces of all the people from High School that never left town?  Fine, you can buy a shirt as a commemoration of graduaton.  After all, you worked hard and earned it!</p>
