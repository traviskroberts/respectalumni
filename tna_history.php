<h1>History of Tau Nu Alpha</h1>

<p>Tau Nu Alpha (or TNA, as it is more typically referred to) was founded in the year of our Lord, 2001 A.D. at Auburn University.  In its inception, TNA was originally intended to be the ultimate anti-fraternity, striving to be the exact opposite of traditional "Greek" fraternities (an early quote would boast "No meetings, no dues, only good times and great booze.")  From the time of its founding, TNA has been referred to as "The Nation's First Roman Fraternity."  However, Tau Nu Alpha's popularity eventually forced it to become much more than a simple anti-fraternity, and it became an entity unto itself.</p>
 
<p>TNA was co-founded by eight men in late 2001.  The founding men of TNA may not have been honor scholars, athletes, or even helpful to their fellow man, but they were, of course, men nonetheless.  The name "Tau Nu Alpha" was created by Ross O'Keefe, one of the co-founders from Kenner, LA, and along with friends James Alkire, Nathan Bush, John Elders, Ross Iser, Chris Gilbert, Robb Huffman, and Jonathan Kilgore TNA hit the ground running.</p>

<p>During that time, the co-founders were notorious for throwing wild, raucous parties at the TNA house off Shug-Jordan in Auburn.  Young men and women were eager to become members of this elite new fraternity, and initiation, in direct opposition to Greek fraternities, was as simple as correctly answering two questions:  (1) Can you drink a beer? (2)  Are you a jackass?  The correct answers that allowed member status were, of course, yes and no, respectively.  Allowing female members was another feature that set Tau Nu Alpha apart and helped it gain respect and recognition from students all across Auburn.</p>

<p>TNA's growth soon became too large for one university, and in 2002 Tau Nu Alpha was brought to the University of Georgia in Athens, GA by Josh Reeves.  Reeves was a long time friend of co-founder Robb Huffman, and both were eager to have the fraternity branch as far and wide as possible.  Thus TNA: The Georgia chapter was formed, with co-founders John Boren, Jim Fowler, Jeremy Oxford, Travis Roberts, and Jonathan Bywaters.</p>

<p>Although all founding members have now become alumni of their respective universities, they have left legacies that are to be upheld by those who now follow behind.  Tau Nu Alpha was never intended to be limited to life in college.  It is a lifelong fraternity of friendship, loyalty, and a lot of drinking.</p>

<p><em>"We hereby uphold to defy the laws of nature, man, and without a doubt those who stand in objection to our creed."</em></p>
